 <p>George is your Lemming. We would like to once again thank you for sponsering George, especially since he is one of the Steppe Lemmings (Don't worry we will kepp the Haribos away from him!) If it was not for people like you George would proably been a starter for a Polar Bear three course meal!</p>

 <p>George is a fairly recent addition to us. We were given him by a shipping vessel that was passing through the Arctic. It turns our George was stuck to their hull and was taken to the port of Aberdeen. Once their people saw him and called the SSPCA to come and collect him. Obviously they were not well equiped to deal with him, so after the rescue they gave him to us and now he is here enjoying life. George is a Steppe Lemming and as such suffers from a form of diabetes. For this reason he has a strict yet resonable diet. He is out going and really likes swimming!. For George we estimate that it will cost us around 30 pounds a month to keep him.</p>
