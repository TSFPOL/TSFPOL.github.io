 <p>Our mission is to make sure that Lemming's are protected just as much as other animals. While yes they do live in the Arctic mainly, some people have them as pets around the world. In the Arctic, people are concerned about the Polar Bear and Penguin and forgot the other wildlife such as the adorable Lemming. That is why we are here. We want to make sure that Lemming's are protected just as much as any other animal. Of course, that does not mean we don't care about those that have been domesticated! We are here for ALL Lemmings and do our best for them. It may be making sure that the sellers are fully licenced to sell them, or perhaps caring for Lemming's that suffer from diabetes (mainly the Steppe Lemming). Of course, some people belive Lemming just walk of cliffs following the leader (fair enough, they do, as the gif shows) but that does not mean we should not care! We would like to thank you for joining our cause and visiting our site!</p>
